  page_title: DealDrive, for a meaningful and collaborative performance
  mobile_header_title: Help
  vp:
    title: Our values and engagements
    intro: DealDrive is a web solution which enables every collaborator to grab his performance review continously, with solid metrics associated. By becoming active in the process, the firm and himself improves their impact
    project_approach:
      title: A continuous approach, where every element of work (activity) defines firm performance
      first_paragraph: Being rigourous, means defining first what is measured. There is no reason to discard or ignore any work made by those who contributed to it. When (s)he finds it relevant, every collaborator can request or create an activity, add their participants to then give their feedbacks. There are many advantages, from the self-esteem as our vote is considered, to have an objective view on evaluation. Based on concrete tasks, it removes personal judgments deprived of any sound basis
      second_paragraph: "At DealDrive, we do not forget that its nonetheless you, as a person, who is judging and that it is your opinion. We guarantee you :"
      no_ai_guarantee:
        title: That your feedbacks are not analysed by any robot or artificial intelligence whatsoever
        first_paragraph: The people in charge of the activity (owners) are responsible for reviewing feedbacks. Neither peremptory judgments nor self-censorship are elements which helps people getting forward !

      confidentiality_assured:
        title: Results visibility strictly limited to participants and a very few number of administrators
        first_paragraph: "Your firm can setup and promote open feedbacks, but we want everyone to remain free of any judgment : this is why your colleagues should neither know what you achieved in an activity where there are not concerned with, nor conservely know that it is you who gave them this feedback"


    customization:
      title: A full range of customizable activities and participants
      first_paragraph: "Evaluate activities is never an easy task. Considering every participant perception, tasks and feedbacks can vary a lot. We tackled this issue by proposing a configurable platform which suits your needs, and asks the question of whether :"
      grading_type:
        intro: Who is evaluated
        first_paragraph: this can be either collaborators, or the proper activity, or a mix

      criterion_type:
        intro: What kind of feedback is expected
        first_paragraph: grades and comments, or pure comments

      participation_type:
        intro: How do we evaluate
        first_paragraph: we can grade while being graded (actif) or we can assess without being assessed (tiers)


    continuous_performance:
      title: Forget the simple snapshot every 6 months or every year, the time of continuous feedback has come
      first_paragraph: As soon as a recurring or one-off task has to be completed, alone or within a group of people, participants are onboarded into the activity so that they share their views, and enable a continuous and smooth feedback. Activity per activity, this builds a performance indicator which is much more meaningful than traditional end of period feedbacks


  my_profile:
    title: My profile
    screen_elements:
      first_paragraph: "Every user accesses to his profile, where he can find his performance indicators and ongoing activity participations :"
      performance_top_indicators: At the top right, <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>his performance and standard deviation</span></b> (spread to the average results computed for all participants). These results are the average of past activities
      kpis: One can find below his <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>performance indicators </span></b>. We can compare them to associated targets, which can be set at a <b>firm</b>, <b>department</b> or <b>user</b> level
      other_elements: Beneath elements consist of his ongoing and past activities, as well as his other performances

    my_results:
      intro: The results evolution can be seen thanks to the button
      first_paragraph: 'We can see their evolution with different level of detail : by <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>activity</span></b> (broader view), <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>stage</b></span> (intermediate view) or <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>criterion</span></b> (most precise view). We can look into a specific criterion, (here, the \Method\ skill) to monitor its evolution. Results are ordered by time and one can see his performance as compared to the average performance, and same thing for the standard deviation.'
      second_paragraph: Below we get access to all the feedbacks which concern us in the activities we were involved

    update:
      title: Update your profile
      first_paragraph: "Find your profile info (such as your role or department) by clicking on your profile or when you connect. Insert a picture by dragging-dropping a picture from your computer.<br><br> If you want to access to your continuous performance and get all your feedbacks click on <span style=color: #2196F3>My Results</span>"
      tip: Please provide a centered photo of you, the picture size being limited to 2 Mo and displayed as 150 x 150 pixels


  activity_dashboard:
    title: The activity dashboard
    first_paragraph: Here we can find all our activities, sorted by <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>status</span></b> (from the future to the completed ones). An activity can be split between different stages, which can contain different participants and/or evaluating criteria (skills)
    exemple: '<span style=font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline>Example</span> : the above review of the intern Pierre Clément is an activity in itself, shared into 2 stages, a mid-term evaluation, and a final evaluation. Michel, his tutor, takes part in the mid-term evaluation and Pierre can also make his auto-assessing, which gives a 2-participant stage, in which Pierre will be graded on 4 different criteria, one of those being \Leadership\.'
    second_paragraph: 'For every stage, the participant can grade those for whom it is possible to give an assessment. The <a class=\btn white-text waves-effect waves-light teal lighten-1\ style=\padding: 0px 10px; cursor: \>Grade</a> button enables participant assessment (see next section)'

  grading_overview_results:
    title: "Activity : assessment and results display"
    first_paragraph: "If you are participating to an activity, you can grade others based on predefined criteria and grading scale. You can also provide a <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>comment</span></b> related to any criterion/skill which may be mandatory depending on the cases. Finally, you can access to the <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>guidelines</span></b> of every participant by clicking on the flag : this will enable you to know what is expected concerning the activity"
    validating_results:
      intro: "Once results are inserted, you can either choose for your feedback to:"
      saving: <b><span style=text-decoration:underline>Save them</span></b>, meaning you can still modify or refine your views thereafter; but bear in mind that your feedback is still pending, preventing the activity from being finalized. You will need to validate your feeedback
      validating: "<b><span style=text-decoration:underline>Validate them</span></b> : a disclaimer will ask you confirmation of your choice, as your feedbacks are definitely saved. You will still be able to check your feedbacks, but then no further action is required from you. Validation process is ongoing until everyone has validated, enabling results to be computed"

    second_paragraph: Depending on your role, you may get access to your own results or those from all participants. You can visualize global results, or by phase/criterion to compare your performance. Below are all the comments left to you

  setup:
    title: Setup
    create_users:
      title: Evaluation would not exist... without users !
      first_paragraph: "Go the <span style=color: #2196F3>Users</span> management webpage, or from your home page) <br>Then click in the <span style=color: #2196F3>Add button</span> at the right bottom to create new users :"
      second_paragraph: You can create as many users as you want by clicking on the green below button. For each user, insert his credentials and email. <br><br> One need to select users department, position and weight to finalize subscription. In case of one these fields is not yet existing, clicking on the blue line below will enable you create new department/position/weight.<br>
      tip: Weight represents the hierarchical factor the user will have in the evaluation process. For example, if it is set to 70 and user is graded in a two-person activity where the other user holds a 100 weight, then users influence in the final grade will be 70/170 = 41 %
      warning: Make sure you insert the user email properly, otherwise he will not be able to receive the subscription link to connect to DealDrive

    roles:
      title: The various roles in DealDrive
      first_paragraph: "Users can either be :"
      administrator: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Administrator</span> : generally an organization HR resource, or director, this user can add other users in DealDrive, create and manage activities, manage firm settings and get access to a full view of results (individual grades and/or transparent feedbacks, as well as and global results)"
      activity_manager: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Activity manager</span> : generally a team manager, this user can create and manage activities, and get access to a partial range or results (anonymized feedbacks, and individual global results)"
      collaborator: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Collaborator</span> : all the other organization members, they can be added in activities or make a activity creation request. They access to their inidividual anonymized feedback, and their individual global results as well as the average activity group performance"
      second_paragraph: "These roles can be modified from time to time (see <a href=#users><span style=color: #2196F3>Users management</span></a> section) <br><br> Finally a user is considered by default as internal to the organization, but you can as well insert clients or third parties to get feedback from them<br><br> When finished, click on the Create Users button to end up the process"



  activities:
    add_stage: Add a stage
    title: Activities
    create_activity:

      first_paragraph: "Go the <span style=color: #2196F3>Activities</span> section (in the top menu, or from your home page)<br>Then click in the <span style=color: #2196F3>Create activity button</span> at the right bottom, it will lead you to the activity creation screen <br> You can either create a simple activity, or, by clicking on the Add link at the top center, a detailed activity."
      admin_paragraph: As a administrator, you can either view the organization activities or your activities
      am_paragraph: As an activity manager, you can see your team activities
      create_paragraph:
      incomplete_warning: If the activity lacks of any mandatory parameters, it will be added in the list of incomplete activities
      simplified:
        title: Create an activity (simplified mode)
        parameters:
          title: Activity parameters
          first_paragraph: "You need to name the activity, and give it a type :"
          pure_feedback: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Pure feedback</span> : Users can only provide a feedback to each activity participant, without grading them specifically"
          evaluation: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Evaluation</span> : Users can grade themselves and the other participants, as well as providing them feedback"
          contribution: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Contribution</span> : Users assess their contribution (in %) on realizing the activity, the sum of all users contributions being equal to 100%. Very relevant in case of bonus sharing within participants"
          second_paragraph: "In case the activity is a evaluation one, then the grading upperbound, lowerbound and grading step should be provided <br><br> Activity needs also to have start and end dates, as well as grading dates <br><br> Activity can also be created as a unique one, or as part of a series of activities. In case you chose the latter, select <span style=color: #2196F3>Recurring activity</span> choice, and defined its related parameters (frequency, grading periods...). All these parameters can still be modified thereafter"
          tip: The activity will be visible but not open to grading prior to grading start date. In case participants have not given their feedbacks or grades until an advanced state of activity grading period, a reminder will be sent to them 1 day prior evaluation end date. In case they miss doing so, they will not be able to provide their feedbacks/grades, so that results will be computed based on existing inputs.
          warning: Activity modification is possible throughout activity lifespan, unless all inputs have been provided by the participants, like adding missing participants or changing dates. However it is highly recommended to change parameters before evaluation start date

        participants:
          title: Adding participants
          first_paragraph: You can add as many participants as you want. Once selected, a participant could be given a precomment (for instance stating its targets, objectives, more generally any info which could help participants evaluating him accurately) <br>
          tip: The activity needs to have a leader whose role is to manage activity parameters and participants. By default, the user who creates the activity is the leader.
          warning: There can be only one leader per activity
          graded_tickbox: "All participants are supposed to receive an input, but in case the <span style=color: #2196F3>Graded tickbox</span> is unticked, then this user will not be graded by others (whereas he can still grade the remaining participants)<br><br> Click on validate button to validate the activity creation. All added participants will receive a participation confirmation email"


      detailed:
        title: Create an activity (detailed mode)
        parameters:
          title: Activity parameters
          first_paragraph: "You need to name the activity, and defined whether it is a single activity or if it belongs to a series of activities. In case you chose the latter, select <span style=color: #2196F3>Recurring activity</span> choice, and defined its related parameters (frequency, grading periods...). All these parameters can still be modified thereafter"

        stages:
          title: Manage stages
          first_paragraph: In this second step you can manage stages. Add stage name, start & end dates, as well as grading periods for each stage.<br><br>
          first_tip: For each stage you will need to link participants; moreover if a user participates in two stages or more in an grading activity, then its final result will be the weighted average of these stages, using stage weights.
          second_tip: A stage can also be seen as a sub-activity, if all users are different between stages
          third_tip: The stage will be visible but not open to grading/feedback prior to evaluation start date. In case participants have not given their feedbacks or grades until an advanced state of the stage grading period, a reminder will be sent to them 1 day prior stage evaluation end date. In case they miss doing so, they will not be able to provide their feedbacks/grades, so that results will be computed based on existing inputs if possible.
          warning: Stage modification is possible throughout its lifespan, unless all inputs have been provided by the participants, like adding missing participants or changing dates. However it is highly recommended to change parameters before evaluation start date

        criteria:
          title: Manage stage criteria
          first_paragraph: "Each stage can possess the various criteria type :"
          pure_feedback: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Pure feedback</span> : Users can only provide a feedback to each activity participant, without grading them specifically"
          evaluation: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Evaluation</span> : Users can grade themselves and the other participants, as well as providing them feedback"
          contribution: "<span style=color: #2196F3>Contribution</span> : Users assess their contribution (in %) on realizing the activity, the sum of all users contributions being equal to 100%. Very relevant in case of bonus sharing within participants"
          second_paragraph: If the stage is a grading evaluation, then grading parameters like upperbound, lowerbound and step should be provided
          tip: If the stage has multiple evaluation criteria with different (lets say one from 0 to 5 and one from 0 to 10), average stage grade will be computed and displayed in % (relative result)

        participants:
          title: Adding stage participants
          first_paragraph: For each stage, add as many participants as you want. Once selected, a participant could be given a precomment (for instance stating its targets, objectives, more generally any info which could help participants evaluating him accurately) <br>
          tip: The stage needs to have a leader whose role is to manage activity parameters and participants. By default, the user who creates the activity is the leader.
          warning: There can be only one leader per stage
          graded_tickbox: "All participants are supposed to receive an input, but in case the <span style=color: #2196F3>Graded tickbox</span> is unticked, then this user will not be graded by others (whereas he can still grade the remaining participants)<br><br> Click on validate button to validate the activity creation. All added participants will receive a participation confirmation email"




      delegation:
        title: Delegate an activity
        first_paragraph: "In case you create an activity but want another user to fill parameters and participants, choose <span style=color: #2196F3>Delegate activity</span> instead of creating the activity yourself."
        second_paragraph: "You need to provide some info, such as activity name, some description to help the activity leader and naturally who will be activity leader within the firm. Then click on the <span style=color: #2196F3>Validate button</span> : it will send a email to a leader as well as add a new pending activity for him in his activity list."

      request:
        title: Request an activity (collaborators only)
        first_paragraph: "In case you request an activity creation, then you need to fill some info, such as the activity name, objectives and who will validate it. You will have the privilege to either disclose your identity as the requester or choose to be anonymous to the validator. Then click on the <span style=color: #2196F3>Validate button</span> : it will send a email to the requester as well as add a new activity to validate for him and a pending activity for you in your respective activity list."

#    quote_gc: Having worked in multiple environments, I noticed that the evaluation process was done without a clear follow-up throughout the year, and was lacking of some consistency, as well as a general feedback from all team members. I decided to take a collaborative stance by designing DealDrive, as it leads to a win-win situation for all stakeholders
#    position_am: Associate
#    quote_am: I worked hands-in-hands in designing the first version, effectively tested among pupils in a project environment. Then I promoted it in my previous firm, and all collaborators are now using it and find DealDrive very useful

#      content_pct_2: 8 %
#      content_end: It is interesting to notice many firms get along with that. Do not belong to that group. If you want to take the most of your client views, there is no such way as onboarding them in the feedback and qualiy loop. Though it might be ackward at first, they will soon realize you are trustworthy by taking the risk to ask for their judgment.

    paragraph_7: "This approach promotes the <b>involvement</b> and <b>commitment</b> of all members who participated to the project. It <b>legitimates</b> your work by your peers and your clients."

    title_1: "Become a pillar in each team by accessing the feedbacks of their projects"
    paragraph_1: "Thanks to your <b>global view</b> you can access to returns and feedbacks of each activity and <b>observe</b> the performance, the strong and weak points and the interactions inside the teams and the projects."
    paragraph_2: "DealDrive <b>accompanies</b> the changes within human resources and allow you to remain close to all functions within the workforce or the direction. Indeed it makes you a part - at least virtually - of teams, and allow you to <b>see and interpret</b> the data to emit <b>guidelines and recommendations</b> to the direction and the managers."
    title_2: "Improve the onboarding of new collaborators in the company"
    paragraph_3: "The recruitment process can be <b>slow and fragile</b> to find the perfect candidate. An failed onboarding is extremely expensive in time (up to hundreds of hours) and in money (from 2000 to 15000 euros) to companies - according to the profiles."
    paragraph_4: "Once the candidate is selected DealDrive <b>supports</b> the company and also the new employee during their <b>integration</b>. Via the application they quickly become <b>operationnal</b> especially since they are partially responsible of their follow-up. They can quickly see if they are aligned with the objectives. <br><br>The meeting points between the company, the manager and the employee are then <b>multiplied</b> compared to a classic onboarding."
    title_3: "Follow the progression per objectives (OKR) of employees and find personnalized formations to help them"
    paragraph_5: "The individual and <b>collective</b> follow-ups of collaborators through objectives that you set in accordance to the company <b>development strategy</b> will give you the insight to select trainings really linked to the needs of each employee.<br><br>DealDrive allows you to set <b>collective objectives</b> to all employees or <b>specific objectives</b> to some of them."

      bp_2:
        title: Ease and maximize your client ROI by giving them a voice
        arg_1: "Turn the fear of asking feedbacks to your clients into power, by granting them an access where they give their assessment in addition to your employees : you will improve your reputation by bringing your deliverables into play."
        arg_2: You will anticipate more easily client needs. Your objective of securing business as well as gaining new market share will be fulfilled more easily

      bp_3:
        title: Get a unique project approach for each task among collaborators

Traditional assessments are time-consuming and old-fashioned, not to mention the lack of followup throughout the year. Save at least 2 working days per year (computation based on a 5-person team)

      bp_2:
        title: Performance gets fully aligned with every employee tasks and projects
        arg_1: Some fashionable solutions give you insights on your employees behaviors or feelings, based on different surveys. We decided to take what we consider a more valuable stance, which is to focus on what is really achieved by your employees. This will make them acknowledge and improve their performance

      bp_3:
        title: Keep your legitimacy on top by enabling your team personal branding
        arg_1: To sum it up, each collaborator feedback is based on his work and is an average of all project collaborators (including himself). Considering this transversal approach, they will be more thankful; it will reduce significantly their indifference and increase their engagement and productivity

        arg_1: As we focus on real concrete tasks made by employees, their assessments are perceived as fully in line with their assigned missions and roles

      bp_3:
        title: Keep your legitimacy on top by enabling your team personal branding
        arg_1: To sum it up, each collaborator feedback is based on his work and is an average of all project collaborators (including himself). Considering this transversal approach, they will be more thankful; it will reduce significantly their indifference and increase their engagement and productivity

      bp_1:
        title: Make collaborative assessment a crucial asset of your employer brand
        arg_1: Take some time to ask to your teams, and - scarce thing - to your clients to get involved in the feedback process is a powerful communication advantage for your firm, well above \greatwashing\ solutions for instance. This is a main source of attractiveness and retention of your existing and future talents

      bp_2:
        title: Give way to what is concretely made by your employees, and free yourself from weekly surveys which are qualitatively poor
        arg_1: A worrying trend is gaining importance, which is data retrieving by all means and for everything. DealDrive restores the meaning of performance and well-being by focusing on day-to-day activities. This is the main reading grid for employees

      bp_3:
        title: An optimal assessment tool for your employees
        arg_1: Being managers who need to make the burden of assessing their team, or workers who need to take note fo their evaluation without necessarily have their voice on how their performance is built, DealDrive grants a transversal approach on the feedback process

      pres_sentence: Have you ever heard about DealDrive, the solution which helps you assess your competencies in addition with your managers ?
      bp_1:
        title: Be a contributor of your assessment
        arg_1: '% !!''Do you how many firms really take care about employees feedback prior their assessment ? 8% !! While keeping most of the \business as usual\ rules, time has come to get more transversality in the assessment process, this is why DealDrive has been created for'

      bp_2:
        title: Identify your strengths and weaknesses, and confront them with your views
        arg_1: The gap between our perception and the one of others within a team can be wide. The best way to get aware of this is to challenge your perception to the other stakeholders, and to analyse the results. Undertaking a task alone or within a team, DealDrive gives you an instant access to your performance.

      bp_3:
        title: Become a leader and request the assessment of your projects and daily tasks
        arg_1: "DealDrive promotes a \bottom-up\ approach : you are given the right to request the creation of activities to be assessed. By doing that you can be assured that every task youre committed to will taken into account"

      finale: I hope this may be of interest for yourself ! Looking forward to starting the experience with you, best,
